*"Reading well, which means reading actively, is thus not only a good in itself, nor is it merely a means to advancement in our work or career. It also serves to keep our minds alive and growing."*

* *"We are all to some extent persons marooned on a desert island. We all face the same challenge that we would face if we were really thereâ€”the challenge of finding the resources within ourselves to live a good human life."*

* *"There is no limit to the amount of growth and development that mind can sustain. However, the mind can atrophy, like the muscles, if it is not used. Then, if we lack resources within ourselves, we cease to grow intellectually, morally and spiritually. And if we cease to grow, we begin to die."*
